---HOW TO DO SHIT---

Use upload file to upload files for the game. Once a person uploads a file, you MUST wait for the next person to upload a new file, and once they do, download that one instead and get rid of the old one. It is recommended you do NOT give a unique name to any files issued. ONLY PUSH A FILE ONCE BEFORE ANOTHER PERSON USES IT.

To edit a room, go to it and unlock the Collisions layer. Do NOT touch any other layer unless you are adding a specific element that is required. Use assets from the mechanics folder and drag them in to the game to make levels!

Finally, to tile a level, go to the tiles layer. Pick a tile from the sprites -> tilemaps folder and draw it in!

It is HIGHLY recommended to only have 1 layer unlocked at a time.

Happy developing!
